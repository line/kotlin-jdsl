## Example

You can see how you can build and execute a query with Kotlin JDSL using the library you are using through the
submodules.

### Data

The submodules all use the same schema and data, which can be seen in the [data.sql](./src/main/resources/data.sql)
and [schema.sql](./src/main/resources/schema.sql) in the [resources](./src/main/resources). Both files are written for
the MySQL.
